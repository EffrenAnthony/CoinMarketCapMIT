# Coin Market Cap API - MIT MERN

## Description
In this project I use [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/) to fetch every single data for crypto currencies in the global market. To do it I used `create-react-app` to create a React Project to implement the frontend application. To fetch the data, as the documentation of the API says, I had to create a backend in order to protect my API keys, otherwise the API should reject the request in the client side.

## Technologies and dependencies: 
`React` using create-creat-app, `AdonisJS` to implement a simple backend to fetch the API. Finally, y used the API from [Coin Market Cap API](https://coinmarketcap.com/api/)
